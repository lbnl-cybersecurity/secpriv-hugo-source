Berkeley Lab [Computing Sciences Research][CRD] is an active participant numerous projects areas of computer security. Its mission-driven emphasis has historically focused on [security for science, including high-performance computing and high-throughput networking environments](/research/scientific-computing), and [security of cyber-physical systems](/research/ceds/), notably in the power grid and in scientific research facilties, such as [maritime vessels](https://blog.trustedci.org/2023/01/announcing-2023-trusted-ci-annual.htm).  These projects include collaborations with numerous other academic, National Lab, and industry partners.  research sponsors have included the [Department of Energy (DOE)][DOE] [Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR)][ASCR] and [Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) research][CEDS research] programs, the [National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)](http://nnsa.energy.gov), the [National Science Foundation (NSF)][NSF]  [Secure and Trustworthy Computing (SaTC)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?from=fund&orgAbbr=NSF&pims_id=504709) program and [Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's [Science and Technology Directorate](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology), and the [National Security Agency][NSA], among others.

Berkeley Lab has had a leadership role in security in scientific computing environments for many years, including the development of the [Zeek (Bro) Network Security Monitor][Zeek], as well as leading several DOE-sponsored activities related to defining a cybersecurity research program within the DOE.  <!--More recently, Berkeley Lab led the coordination of the ["Cyber research" Enterprise Cyber Capability (ECC)][iJC3] of the DOE-wide Integrated Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center (iJC3) — a sponsored research program involving ten DOE National Laboratories as performers.-->  Berkeley Lab is the lead institution of [Trusted CI, the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence]({{< ref "/project/nsf-trustedci.md" >}}).
