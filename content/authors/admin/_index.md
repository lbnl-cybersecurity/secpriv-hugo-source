Berkeley Lab [Computing Sciences Research][CRD] is an active participant numerous projects areas of computer security. Its mission-driven emphasis has historically focused on [security for science, including high-performance computing and high-throughput networking environments](/research/research-cyberinfrastructure), and [security of cyber-physical systems](/research/ceds/), notably in the power grid.  These projects include collaborations with numerous other academic, National Lab, and industry partners.  research sponsors have included the [Department of Energy (DOE)][DOE] [Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR)][ASCR] and [Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) research][CEDS research] programs, the [National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)](http://nnsa.energy.gov), the [National Science Foundation (NSF)][NSF]  [Secure and Trustworthy Computing (SaTC)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?from=fund&orgAbbr=NSF&pims_id=504709) program and [Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) office, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's [Science and Technology Directorate](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology), and the [National Security Agency][NSA], among others.

Berkeley Lab has had a leadership role in security in scientific computing environments for many years, including the development of the [Zeek (Bro) Network Security Monitor][Zeek], as well as leading several DOE-sponsored activities related to defining a cybersecurity research program within the DOE.  <!--More recently, Berkeley Lab led the coordination of the ["Cyber research" Enterprise Cyber Capability (ECC)][iJC3] of the DOE-wide Integrated Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center (iJC3) — a sponsored research program involving ten DOE National Laboratories as performers.-->  Berkeley Lab is the lead institution of [Trusted CI, the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence]({{< ref "/project/nsf-trustedci.md" >}}).

Recent highlights of LBNL Computing Sciences' cybersecurity research activities include:

<!--
* Developing findings reports and solutions guides for [scientific data integrity](http://hdl.handle.net/2022/24910), [scientific data confidentiality](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cz7m1ws), [software assurance in science](https://blog.trustedci.org/2021/12/publication-of-trusted-ci-guide-to.html), the [security of operational technology in science](https://blog.trustedci.org/2022/01/announcing-2022-trusted-ci-annual.html), and [building security into maritime and polar NSF Major Facilities by design](https://blog.trustedci.org/2023/01/announcing-2023-trusted-ci-annual.htm).

* Development of [secure computation architectures]({{< ref "/project/desc.md" >}}) optimized for scientific computing to ensure trustworthiness of scientific data from the edge to the HPC center.

* Development and application of differential privacy to [power grid]({{< ref "/project/ceds-privacy.md" >}}) and [vehicle mobility]({{< ref "/project/csr-private-data.md" >}}) data and applications.

* Development of security monitoring systems for cyber-physical systems that [integrate insights about the physical limitations of those systems into network security monitoring]({{< ref "/project/ceds-cps-security.md" >}}) and that [leverage high-resolution physical sensors combined with SCADA to identify cyberattacks on power grid distribution systems]({{< ref "/project/ceds-upmu.md" >}}).

* Co-leading the development of the [Open Science Cyber Risk Profile (OSCRP)](http://trustedci.github.io/OSCRP/) --- a document designed to help researchers understand the cyber risks to their work.  

* Development of the [Medical Science DMZ]({{< ref "/project/medical-science-dmz.md" >}}) design pattern as a method that allows data flows at scale while simultaneously addressing the HIPAA Security Rule and related regulations governing biomedical data and appropriately managing risk.

* Developed definitions and research roadmaps for [hardware/software co-design of future HPC systems](https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/ascr-hpc-cybersecurity-codesign/), high-throughput networks, and networked scientific instruments to build cybersecurity in by design. &rArr; Led directly to HPC cybersecurity elements of DOE funding solicitations and has been central to [NIST HPC Security working group](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/high-performance-computing-security).

* Development of [secure computation architectures]({{< ref "/project/desc.md" >}}) optimized for scientific computing to ensure trustworthiness of scientific data from the edge to the HPC center.

* Development and application of differential privacy to [power grid](https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/ceds-privacy/) and [vehicle mobility](https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/csr-private-data/) data and applications &rArr; The DOE Office of [Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER)](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/office-cybersecurity-energy-security-and-emergency-response) is seeking to deploy the former operationally and the latter has already enabled mobility research otherwise not possible due to data sharing restrictions.

* Developed the first practical approaches to [integrate physics of operational technology in the power grid with intrusion detection]({{< ref "/project/ceds-cps-security.md" >}}) to ensure their secure operation. &rArr; Now broadly used in applied research efforts globally, and appear in DOE funding solicitations and Congressional budget appropriations.

* Co-leading the *[Open Science Cyber Risk Profile (OSCRP)](http://trustedci.github.io/OSCRP/)* working group --- an approach to help research cyberinfrastructure operators understand cyber risks. &rArr; Now a recommended reference in all [NSF CICI solicitations](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505159) since 2018 and the [NSF Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) (21-107, Dec. 2021)](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf21107).

* Codification of the “[Medical Science DMZ](http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/6/1199.article-info)” — a “network design pattern” for enabling secure, high-volume, high-throughput transfer of sensitive data, such as data subject to HIPAA or CUI regulations. &rArr; Now used by companies and research institutions globally, including  the NSF [Global Research Platform](https://www.theglobalresearchplatform.net/).


<!--
* Development of techniques detecting misuse of high-performance computing resources using both [on-system]({{< ref "/project/ascr-ids-hpc.md" >}}) and [off-system]({{< ref "/project/inferring-computing.md" >}}) side channels.

* Development of a research roadmap for [co-designing high-performance computing systems with security built in]({{< ref "/project/ascr-hpc-cybersecurity-codesign.md" >}}).
