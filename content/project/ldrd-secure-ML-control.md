## Project Summary

Numerous DOE-relevant processes are becoming automated and adaptive, using machine learning techniques.  Such processes include vehicle and traffic navigation guidance, intelligent transportation systems, adaptive control of grid-attached equipment, large scientific instruments.  
This creates a vulnerability for a cyber attacker to sabotage processes through tainted training data or specially crafted inputs.  Consequences might be tainted manufactured output, traffic collisions, power outages, or damage to scientific instruments or experiments. This project is developing secure machine learning methods that will enable safer operation of automated, adaptive, learning-driven "cyber-physical system" processes.
