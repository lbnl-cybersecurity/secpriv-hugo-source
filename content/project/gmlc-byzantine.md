## Background

This project aims to explore applications of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) architecture in combination with Machine Learning (ML/AI) methods to ensure that the bulk power system, including protective relays in the transmission grid, and associated substation and control center systems, can perform intrusion tolerant operations. 

This project is funded by several offices within the U.S.  Department of Energy under the auspices of the DOE Grid Modernization Initiative.  The project is led by PNNL.
