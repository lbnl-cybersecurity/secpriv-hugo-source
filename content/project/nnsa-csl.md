Using seed funding from the NNSA CIO, this consortium of eight DOE laboratories worked to form an enduring, national computer security research laboratory to address cybersecurity threats. Research efforts that the laboratory would address ranged from very short-range, tactical issues that leverage current capabilities, to very long-range research with results and solutions that may not be deployable for over 20 years. LBNL's effort was led by Deb Agarwal and [Sean Peisert](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/).

More information is available on other Berkeley Lab R&D projects focusing on [cybersecurity](/projects/) in general, as well as specifically on [cybersecurity for scientific and high-performance computing](/research/scientific-computing/).
