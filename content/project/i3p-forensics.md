This project is looking at establishing a rigorous, scientific model of forensic logging and analysis that is both efficient and effective at establishing the data that is necessary to record in order to understand past events. Additional applications include e-voting and forensic evidence in the courtroom. While forensics traditionally looks at available data and attempts to draw conclusions from it, we, in contrast, seek to understand the questions that we want to answer, and then derive what data is necessary to support answers to those questions.
