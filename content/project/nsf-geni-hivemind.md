This project was funded by NSF's CISE Directorate, and was led by Sean Peisert. The project sought to define and prototype a security layer using a method of intrusion detection based on mobile agents and swarm intelligence. The project's goal was to provide a lightweight, decentralized, intrusion detection method that is adaptable to changing threats while communicating suspicious activity across hierarchical layers to humans who can respond when needed. The goal was to augment, not replace, more traditional security mechanisms.
