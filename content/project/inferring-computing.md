This project involves using power data for monitoring use of computing systems, including supercomputers and large computing centers. By using power data, as opposed to data provided by the computing environment itself, the technology collects the data non-invasively.  More information is available at the [LBNL Innovation and Partnerships Office](http://ipo.lbl.gov/lbnl2016-053/).
