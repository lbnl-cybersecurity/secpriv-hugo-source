Current key management architectures are not designed for machine-to-machine communication, are designed around an "always online" mentality, and are often burdensome to manage (key distribution, revocation lists, governance, etc.). This project is designing and developing a key management system to meet the unique requirements of electrical distribution systems (EDSs). Namely it is disruption tolerant, scales well, is centrally managed, has policy enforcement and auditing, automates key management services for devices, etc...

This project is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's [Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS)](http://energy.gov/oe/services/technology-development/energy-delivery-systems-cybersecurity) program.
