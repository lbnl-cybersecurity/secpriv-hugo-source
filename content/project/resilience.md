LBNL's component of this project focused on mapping and analyzing the qualities of resilient networks by investigating components of redundancy, diversity, quality of service, etc... The project's goal is to be able to quantify and compare the resilience of networks in a scientifically meaningful way.
 
This project was led at LBNL by [Sean Peisert](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/).
 
More information is available at the [UC Davis resilience project web site](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/projects/resilience.html).

More information is available on other Berkeley Lab R&D projects focusing on [cybersecurity](/projects/) in general, as well as specifically on [cybersecurity for scientific and high-performance computing](/research/scientific-computing/).
