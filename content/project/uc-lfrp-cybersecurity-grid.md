## Background

This project will bring together a multi-disciplinary UC-Lab team of cybersecurity and electricity infrastructure experts to investigate, through both cyber and physical modeling and physics-aware cybersecurity analysis, the impact and significance of cyberattacks on electricity distribution infrastructure.  We will develop new strategies for mitigating vulnerabilities, detecting intrusion, and protecting against detrimental system wide impact. This project will build a new knowledge base to address both theoretical and practical challenges in electricity distribution cybersecurity.
