The mission of Trusted CI, the National Science Foundation Cybersecurity of Excellence, is to improve the cybersecurity of NSF computational science and engineering projects, while allowing those projects to focus on their science endeavors.

As the National Science Foundation Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, Trusted CI draws on expertise from multiple internationally recognized institutions, including [Indiana University](https://cacr.iu.edu/), the [University of Illinois](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](https://www.psc.edu/), and [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). Drawing on this expertise, Trusted CI collaborates with NSF-funded research organizations to focus on addressing the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by such entities. In addition to our leadership team, a world-class [Trusted CI Advisory Committee](https://www.trustedci.org/advisory-committee) adds its experience and a critical eye to the center's strategic decision-making.

Berkeley Lab is the lead institution for Trusted CI.  Berkeley Lab's additional roles in Trusted CI have included co-leading the [Open Science Cyber Risk Profile (OSCRP)](http://trustedci.github.io/OSCRP/) working group -- a cross-disciplinary group of computer security professionals and scientific researchers that worked to develop a document designed to help researchers understand the cyber risks to their work.  It has also led studies into [scientific data integrity](http://hdl.handle.net/2022/24910), [scientific data confidentiality](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cz7m1ws), [software assurance in science](https://blog.trustedci.org/2021/12/publication-of-trusted-ci-guide-to.html), the [security of operational technology in science](https://blog.trustedci.org/2022/01/announcing-2022-trusted-ci-annual.html), and [building security into NSF Major Facilities by design](https://blog.trustedci.org/2023/01/announcing-2023-trusted-ci-annual.htm).
