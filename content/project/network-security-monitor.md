## Project Summary

[Vern Paxson](http://www.icir.org/vern/) developed the initial version of the Bro Network Security Monitor initial version in 1995 while at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The original software was called "Bro" as an "Orwellian reminder that monitoring comes hand in hand with the potential for privacy violations."  Bro changed its name to [Zeek](https://zeek.org) and has also been commercialized in a spinoff called [Corelight](http://www.icir.org/vern/).

Paxson first deployed Zeek while at the Berkeley Labin 1996, and the USENIX Security Symposium published [Paxson's original paper on Zeek](https://www.usenix.org/conference/7th-usenix-security-symposium/bro-system-detecting-network-intruders-real-time) in 1998, and awarded it the Best Paper Award that year.  The paper was awarded a ["Test of Time Award" in 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/7th-usenix-security-symposium/bro-system-detecting-network-intruders-real-time) for its lasting impact on the research community.

The Berkeley Lab's work with Zeek/Bro has continued over the years including [100G capable network monitoring using Bro in 2015](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/cpp/100G+Intrusion+Detection); applications of Zeek/Bro to the [Science DMZ](https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) and [Medical Science DMZ](https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/medical-science-dmz/) network design patterns; the commercial spinoff of Zeek/Bro into [Corelight](https://corelight.com/)(previously Broala) by Paxson, Robin Sommer, and LBNL Scientific Division Director / ESnet Director, Greg Bell; and Berkeley Lab and ESnet personnels' continued roles on the [Zeek Leadership Team](https://zeek.org/leadership-team/).

The canonical reference for Zeek/Bro is Paxson's 1999 ``[Bro: A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time](http://www.icir.org/vern/papers/bro-CN99.pdf).''
