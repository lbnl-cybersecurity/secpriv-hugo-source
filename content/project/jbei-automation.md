## Project Summary

In this project, LBNL Computing Sciences Research supported the automation of synthetic biology research pipelines supporting the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, including ingest and analysis of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and feedstocks-to-fuels pipelines.

The work was led at JBEI by [Héctor García Martín](https://sites.google.com/view/hectorgarciamartinhomepage/) and supported by LBNL Computing Sciences Research by [Reinhard Gentz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uToyU5oAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sean Peisert](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/).

This project was supported by the DOE [Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI)](https://www.jbei.org) and the DOE [Agile BioFoundry (ABF)](https://agilebiofoundry.org).
